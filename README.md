# Knight's Travails

This project uses a breadth-first graph search with backtracking to find the shortest path for the knight to travel between any two squares on a chessboard.

My program's strategy is a simplified version of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) - simplified because the distance between any two neighbouring nodes on a Knight's chessboard is always one.
